Trophies is a management system designed to help manage trophy businesses.

It started out as a FoxPro 2.6 Project.
Then it was changed into a FoxPro 6.0 Project.
Then it was changed into a FoxPro 9.0 Project.

The next version under development is a .net project as the front end with FoxPro as the backend.
